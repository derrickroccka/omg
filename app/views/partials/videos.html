<!-- This ng-controller is placed to assign a controller  -->
<!-- Normally, it would be bound in app.js routes -->
<!-- Actually, it does but what about partials? -->
<!-- If this view is called via partial we don't come from a route-->
<!-- Conclusion: we'll bind VideosCtrl inside the tag -->
<div ng-controller="VideosCtrl">
  <li ng-repeat="vid in videos">
   {{vid}}
 </li>
</div>
